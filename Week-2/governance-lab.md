### 🛡️ Cloud Governance & Resource Optimization
**Evidence:** `azure-governance-policies-assigned.png`

In this lab, I acted as a Cloud Architect to implement financial and organizational guardrails for a simulated client.

**Key Actions Taken:**
*   **SKU Restriction Policy:** Enforced a policy to only allow cost-effective B-series and D-series VMs. This prevents "Bill Shock" by blocking high-cost G-series resources.
*   **Tagging Enforcement:** Implemented a mandatory "Environment" tag. This ensures all resources are categorized (e.g., Prod, Dev, Test) for 100% billing accuracy and resource lifecycle management.
*   **Significance:** These policies represent the transition from basic cloud support to proactive Cloud Governance, ensuring the environment remains optimized as the business scales.
